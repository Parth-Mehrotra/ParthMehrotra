							I joined AWM's Model Management team as a full stack engineer. This team primarily deals with portfolio tooling and implementation. Our software helps advisors craft portfolios that meet the constraints of our clients and the guidelines of our research team.
						</p>
						<p>
							I contribute to several portions of our technical stack: improving performance of our backend by optimizing queries, enabling our UI to retrieve information from other teams within AWM, and writing tools to maintain consensus with other stores of data within JP Morgan.
						</p>
						<p>
							To develop my leadership skills, I've taken on the role of Scrum Master for our development team. Running sprint planning and retrospectives has taught me a lot about the drift that tends to happen between our goals and outcomes. It's also taught me the importance of effective communication across different domains and with different types of people (technical, users, management).

						<p>As a software engineer I wanted more control over the way I write code. I want to be able to invest in an
							environment and not lose all those investments every time I'm working with a different team that uses a
							different set of tools (IDE's). I thought about the way I wrote code, and realized that I could sacrifice the
							convenience that Code Completion and Code Refactoring bring in favor a more general tool set that I could
							customize much more deeply. I also found it extremely convenient to be able to deploy my environment by running
							a script, primarily on new dev/prod servers. I created this environment using scripts that configure Zsh, TMUX,
							and Vim, I've made these scripts available on Github, and made a video detailing the configuration. Feel free to
							browse the <a href="">Repository</a> or check out the overview below. </p>
