							<p>As a software engineer I wanted more control over the way I write code. I want to be able to invest in an environment and not lose all those investments every time I'm working with a different team that uses a different set of tools (IDE's). I thought about the way I wrote code, and realized that I could sacrifice the convenience that Code Completion and Code Refactoring bring in favor a more general tool set that I could customize much more deeply. I also found it extremely convenient to be able to deploy my environment by running a script, primarily on new dev/prod servers. I created this environment using scripts that configure Zsh, TMUX, and Vim, I've made these scripts available on Github, and made a video detailing the configuration. Feel free to browse the <a href="">The Repository</a> or check out the overview below. </p>
